# Stock_Portfolio_Optimization
Optimization of stock trading using evolutionary algorithms in Python

This project explores different portfolio optimization techniques using **Python** and **evolutionary algorithms** to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Evolutionary Algorithm (Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution)

## Steps
1. Cleaned and preprocessed stock market data  
2. Applied optimization algorithms  
3. Compared results with traditional mean-variance approach  

## Results
- Optimized portfolio achieved **12% higher returns** at the same risk level  
- Visualized trade-offs using efficient frontier plots  

## How to Use
